ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Larissa!

After building a career in finance, I decided to follow my true passion: technology! ðŸš€ In 2025, I dove into the world of programming by joining the immersive experience at 42 Porto, an incredible journey where I learned the fundamentals of programming.

Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my knowledge of the C language, developing my problem-solving skills, and exploring data structures. My background in financial management has given me an analytical and strategic mindset, which I now apply to programming challenges.

ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m currently studying:

â€¢ Data structures and algorithms in C

â€¢ Logic and computational thinking

â€¢ Technical English for software development
